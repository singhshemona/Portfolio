This is the same reason why the timing of when you read a particular book can be imperative to your development, or why so many applications use algorithms in an attempt to tailor content to what they think you need most in that time. This is what happened when I came across a video titled The Toolbox Fallacy. I had heard of similar concepts in my early college years and saved it as a mental note to come back to later. I wasn't particularly infatuated with it then but I had a feeling the message being conveyed was something I may need to hear later in life."},{id:2,link:"https://www.notion.so/shemona/Liquid-Thinking-1398b67244bb4eefa13d9335bc3042fe",title:"Liquid Thinking",date:"May 23, 2020",timeToRead:10,content:"By the end of my freshman year of college I had picked up a minor in Digital Arts.

The conversations I had with this person lingered in my head for the next few days, but even more importantly the energy they imbued within me never quite left.
