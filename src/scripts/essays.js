    blurb: 'Towards the middle of 2020 I stumbled upon the term \'second brain.\' I was instantly intrigued. Much like most of the worlds I stumble into, in some ways I had been opening its doors long before I learnt its principles.',

    timeToRead: 10,
    blurb: 'Reading the word \'notes\' likely elicits a cringe response. We\'ve all grown up taking notes. Whether it\'s because we were genuinely interested in the class or because that\'s what we saw the smart students do, who knows. I do know that taking notes is something we\'re never taught. And like most activities associated with school (reading, writing, learning) we enthusiastically wipe our hands of them upon graduation.',

    blurb: 'We\'ve reached a point in technological development where our devices understand how to satiate our desires more than any human ever will. We\'re drowning in information that gets filtered through our unique perspectives. Regardless of how refined that perspective might be, it\'s overwhelming. What\'s right, what\'s wrong and what\'s best for you is preached by millions of strangers on various platforms.',

    title: 'Changing the Narrative',
    timeToRead: 9,
    blurb: 'We all tell ourselves stories everyday, about everyone and everything around us. These stories can be referred to as narratives. They are so embedded in the root of our ways, so subconscious, we often aren\'t even aware we function according to them. They are not necessarily mental models so much as they are the instinctive ways we explain the world and its happenings to our brains. Because they influence our instincts, they feed the everyday reactions we have and determine the vibrations we reverberate.',

    blurb: 'The beautifully monstrous world of the internet has enabled essentially every convenience we can think of today. Pondering of a world where it didn\'t exist would leave the incoming generation dumbfounded. We have adapted to it in remarkably irreversible ways, leaving us connected to a previously inconceivable degree. It\'s due to the internet\'s magnificence that we have the widespread capability to take our innovation as far as the reaches of our imagination.',

    blurb: 'Sometimes when faced with new advice, you may not yet be at a point in your life where that piece of information can resonate with you. This is the same reason why the timing of when you read a particular book can be imperative to your development, or why so many applications use algorithms in an attempt to tailor content to what they think you need most in that time. This is what happened when I came across a video titled The Toolbox Fallacy. I had heard of similar concepts in my early college years and saved it as a mental note to come back to later. I wasn\'t particularly infatuated with it then but I had a feeling the message being conveyed was something I may need to hear later in life.',

    blurb: 'By the end of my freshman year of college I had picked up a minor in Digital Arts. I wasn\'t quite sure where its relevance was to my Computer Science major but it peaked my curiosity and that was valuable enough. As I grew to enjoy the work Digital Arts classes required of me as much as (if not more) than what my Computer Science classes assigned, I was committed to figuring out a possible intersection between the two for my career. There is an evolving, exhilarating world that exists where design meets technology, and I was determined to be a part of it.',

    blurb: 'Towards the end of 2018, I was introduced to someone who I found to be captivating. It started off as a casual meetup over some food and ended up feeling like we were bothering the waiter for overstaying during rush hour. The conversations I had with this person lingered in my head for the next few days, but even more importantly the energy they imbued within me never quite left. I had an \'I can\' attitude towards everything afterwards and an extra bounce to my step.',
