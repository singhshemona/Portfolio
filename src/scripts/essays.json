      "content": "<p class=\"thesis\">\"Writing is not the outcome of thinking; it is the medium in which thinking takes place\" - Sonke Rohne</p><p>Writing has been a craft close to my heart for as long as I could speak. The interest sparked with creative writing, where my amazement with bringing to life magical universes spiraling within my mind never ceased. I could form complex obstacles, add layers of depth to characters, play out the endless possibilities of ridiculous scenarios. For a child, writing was one of the many artistic ways I dreamt with my eyes wide open.</p><p>As I've aged, writing accompanied me along the ride. Throughout the years it's adapted to account for life's changing needs. While it began as a vessel for my enigmatic imagination, the stories started becoming slightly more realistic, then matured into introspective thoughts and journal entries. Today, writing has become my primary tool for analysis as well as caters as a sage for my incentivized, paranoid monkey mind.</p><p>I'd like to answer the question of 'why I write' with writing's current fulfillment in my life. (I still have the sporadic moments of exploring a fiction tale every now and then, but the stories tend to be less based around the supernatural.)</p><p>I mentioned Sonke Ahrens' book in a previous post titled <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://shemonasingh.com/how-to-take-non-academic-notes\">How to Take Non-Academic Notes</a>, Ahrens is a huge advocate for the craft of writing, seeing it as a means of many intellectual pursuits:</p><p class=\"quote\">“Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding, and generating ideas we have.”</p><p>His approach to seeing writing as therapy, companionship and ideation is a path that I have found myself treading for the past few years. Writing has no doubt helped me to share more carefully articulated thoughts with the world in forms of posts, organized emails or intentional conversations but most importantly, it's helped me make sense of my mind. It's helped formulate my truths. Regardless of whether I share my thoughts, the act of conveying my understanding put my thoughts on the line. I am naturally incline to organized them in a more rational sense or improve my beliefs if they feel faulty or biased in the face of valid contradictory evidence.</p><p>In a similar wavelength, author Steven Johnson talks about how <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ZK58TA/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1\">reading and writing are inseparable activities</a>. Reading strengthens writing while writing elaborates reading. The cyclic nature of the two goes back to the overall goal Ahrens is advocating for - a system involving a continuous effort to make sense of the world. The world is filled with nuggets of wisdom waiting to be inherited by your views or stamped with your identity. Andy Matuschak has <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zg3fYweZpbHeBTpcYke5mF4ZfrJutYcQEtFo\">a great note on this idea</a>. He talks about how when you write about what you read, it inevitably turns into connections with other parts of your mind, helping you to elaborate on your mental models. By reading and reading only, you take what is given to you, adding to your repertoire of knowledge. But it cannot truly become a thread in the tapestry of your thinking until you engage with it. This is of course for those books with which you would like for it to have an impact on your behavior or perspective.</p><p>This 'tapestry of your thinking' alludes to an idea that has been brought up by Cal Newport in his podcast episode titled 'Fleeing a Collapsing Career, Taking Notes on Books, Building a Deep Life', where he discusses what it means to get your life in order. One critical step is contemplation - develop your philosophies and ethical systems, ignore intellectual group-ism, and \"sit at the feet of some of the greatest thinkers in history\" with long form content and books. Writing helps us to do this. Rather than go along with the default strands of thinking we've been accustomed to, we allow ourselves to entertain and explore other modes of thought and gain a sense of agency in our lives.</p><p>You may be wondering what it means to write about what you read. This is up to interpretation. As you read anything actively, your mind is exploring the boundaries of the argument. Do you agree with what is being said? Why or why not? In what ways does what this author is saying connect to other literature you've consumed? How can this advice be applied to your life currently? There are several directions to take once your mind is tuned to viewing reading as an accomplice in your pursuit of truth.</p><p>Apart from your own developments, if you publish your writings to a public space, your responsibilities change slightly. When you write to make sense for yourself, it can be easy to traverse down familiar paths of thinking since those are the ones that came by default to you. But as Matuschak puts in an article contemplating the current <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://numinous.productions/ttft/\">state of our tools of thought</a>:</p><p class=\"quote\">“The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think.”</p><p>When we have to consider an audience, we are forced to consider how what we are saying could be digested by a variety of perspectives. Considering the implications of your words is also a great step towards a healthy interpersonal life.</p><p>Apart from the personable skills, when you write intentionally it's encourages elaboration, but also compression. You may find yourself using speak not normally practiced with close friends (which is a great way to develop your communication). Once you reach a certain level of understanding for a topic, that is when the compression comes in. You are able to convey only the words that are needed in order to deliver a point.</p><p>Venkatesh Rao over at Ribbonfarm describes storytelling from the perspective of two content creators. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2021/02/16/storytelling-harmon-vs-mckee/\">It's a fascinating dive into what makes a memorable storyteller</a>. He gives an example of how in a masterclass on stories producer Dan Harmon was able to compress the entire hero's journey arch into the following words: 'you → need → go → search → find → take → return → change'. Condensing the entirety of one of the most commonly discussed literature patterns into eight words is the brilliance of his simplification. And without a doubt, we as an audience understand the flow. This ability to condense, Rao observes is a pattern in effective business leaders as well. They are able to distill complicated ideas into only what is needed for the audience, in an engaging way. I'd go so far as to say it's a quality helpful for anyone of any position to practice, something that will make you far easier to collaborate with.</p><p>What writing does for you will be unique to your needs. When looking back at what you've written down, your notes might instigate new revelations. They may contribute to projects in progress or theories you've had bubbling in ways that were not able to resonate when you first recorded them. They may rekindle previous points in your life where you were questioning something you now feel more or less sure of. They form a kind of reflection for the areas of your life you write about, but a reflection that evolves with the changing waters of time.</p><p>I'm reminded of a quote from the lovely movie The Intouchables, that I think sums this up well. Aristocrat Philippe asks his caretaker Driss: \"Why are people interested in art?\" Driss responds, \"It’s all business, I guess.\" To which Philippe tenaciously replies, \"No, it’s the trace of our passage on this earth.\"</p><p>This passage, much like other art forms, is what writing traces for me.</p>"

      "content": "<p class=\"thesis\">Create a system to engage with the contents of what you've learned to provide meaning to what you've read as well as build relevant knowledge.</p><p>Towards the middle of 2020 I stumbled upon the term 'second brain.' Instantly, I was intrigued. Much like most of the worlds I stumble into, in some ways I had been opening its doors long before I learnt its principles.</p><p>Information stored in the brain is similar to the internet in that it's a mapping of connections. Sure, the brain only holds on to information relevant to a person's survival and fulfillment, but they both work within the concept of a network. In fact, there are some ways in which the brain is flawed in this sense. If you store a phone number in your brain, you may or may not remember it. But if the number is saved in your phone, the steps to retrieve it require little thought and you can allocate that space in your brain for more pertinent data. The second brain community wishes to harness the immense power in today's digital storage capabilities to upgrade the way our brain transforms data to wisdom. Rather than storing what resonates with you in your brain and hoping to remember it when needed, use the power of technology to keep knowledge in a retrievable visual format.</p><p>The key to this is taking good notes. To do this, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://shemonasingh.com/how-to-take-non-academic-notes\">read this blog post first</a>. I'm going to continue with this post assuming you've read that one or at least read <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes\">How to Take Smart Notes</a>.</p><p>Once you've built yourself a decent collection of highlights, quotes and curated notes with your ideas and thoughts, it can be easy to think the work ends there. But, the next step is the most crucial. You don't want to simply toss them away until the next time you decide to take notes. How you store them and more importantly in what way you connect them, is the premise of the Second Brain.</p><p>There are countless forums surfing the internet discussing which note-taking tool is the best for implementing such a system. I happen to use Notion. Once you get a feel for <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-essential-requirements-for-choosing-a-notes-app-as-your-second-brain/\">how you want to organize your notes and in what ways you would like to retrieve them</a>, you'll naturally lean towards one tool. Look into the features of the most popular ones but don't put more than 2 days of thought into picking.</p><p>When learning about building a Second Brain, you'll likely come across German Sociologist Niklas Luhmann. His iconic system of maintaining a second brain is the premise of the book How to Take Smart Notes. Luhmann called his system a Zettelkasten - that is, German for 'slip-box'. This was back before the days of the internet, so Luhmann's Zettelkasten was all physical: a box of index cards. He took his notes on index cards, then stored them next to cards that were pondering similar questions, ideas or thoughts. That's the distinction here, a Zettelkasten is not meant to be a database pigeon-holing notes into neatly labeled categories. It's to be an evolving system that adapts to mimic the growth of your mind. It reflects new connections in the same creative manner as the brain.</p><p>Throughout my research on the Zettelkasten method, I compiled some essential tips to follow in order to make this system effective. I find that this list covers everything you need to know, but if you're interested in reading more about Luhmann's productive methods of storage and retrieval, you can read <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://shemonasingh.com/how-to-take-non-academic-notes\">one of the four articles linked at the bottom of this post</a>.</p><ul><li>In terms of the general structure for a second brain, Luhmann had two general boxes that all his cards went into: 1) Bibliographical (Reference) box - contained references and brief notes on the content of what he's read. 2) Ideas (Slip) box - contained observations, ideas, questions. How might you make an idea detailed enough to stand on its own, without the context of the book or the associated highlight? Instead of brainstorming (which relies on only the immediate ideas available in your head that can be drawn upon in the moment), the ideas box acts as a better solution for generating creativity.</li><li>When adding a new note to the Zettelkasten (slip-box), instead of asking \"under which category do I store this note?\" You should ask \"In which context will I want to stumble on this note again?\" Important note: It's much easier to ponder the question of 'context' when you have multiple, simultaneous projects and interests ongoing. That's when the full potential of a second brain is truly realized. How might this note relate to your current thinking, research, hobbies, or side projects? File it under a future blog post topic, a panel discussion you're speaking at, or an ongoing collaboration with a peer. Concrete, near-term deliverables are preferred over abstract categories.</li><li>Revisit existing notes and update any connections between them and a new note. Notes that stand out to you but you aren't yet able to put a finger on what it means to you, store separately - these are your interim notes. Luhmann advises to review your interim notes daily. This regular visitation helps to see how their purpose might have evolved after reviewing relatable work or other seeds of thinking that have come to fruition.</li><li>No hierarchy - Apart from a general broad concept linking to a train of detailed thought, there should be little to no hierarchy. The notes are leaves on a tree, ideally densely connected in a way where it might even be difficult to tell which leaf is the 'starting point'.</li><li>For those concepts that you find have a plentitude of trailing ideas or links, it's nice to include a table of contents. This is already a feature in Notion, other note-taking tools may provide something similar.</li></ul><p>Above anything else you gather about how a Zettelkasten should work, know that it should feel alive. It can be amended or taken apart. As a reflection of your thought patterns it should be straightforward to navigate. If the system feels like it's difficult to change, it likely won't be beneficial much longer. Another fact worth noting is that making the connection between a new note and its place in the Zettelkasten should be challenging. This will not be mindless work, you need to be actively thinking about which location will make the suggestions of this note thrive.</p><p>This might be overwhelming for someone wanting to build a digital second brain. I had an idea of what to avoid and how the system should operate but not sure how the Reference and Slip Box would translate to Notion. It wasn't until I landed upon Hiran Venugopalan's article <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://hfactor.medium.com/building-slip-box-using-notion-a53b045c6f40\">On Building Slip Box Using Notion</a> that it finally clicked. (I'm sure many of these structures can be built to a certain degree of equivalence with other note-taking applications).</p><p>Essentially there are two databases, both of type table. The 'Bibliographical (Reference) box' would be a table of sources, i.e. things I've consumed like books, podcasts, videos. Each source would be linked to its corresponding ideas, concepts, and quotes mentioned in the 'Ideas (Slip) box' table. One beauty of Notion is that it allows you to link tables, so the two tables can easily reference each other. Knowing this, I then jotted down a rough idea of the properties or content I'd like a card from each box to contain:</p><p>Bibliography Box Card Properties:</p><ul><li>One line summary of the source</li><li>Author(s)</li><li>Conceptual Keywords (think - in which circumstance will I stumble upon this note?)</li><li>Rating (out of 5)</li><li>Time spent consuming (start and end dates or just one day)</li><li>Medium of consumption (book, article, podcast, etc)</li><li>Link to source(s) (if applicable)</li><li>Connection to Slip box database so that Notion shows all cards referencing this source</li></ul><p>Slip Box Card Properties and Content:</p><ul><li>Conceptual highlights written in my own words - counter-arguments, counter-factual questions like 'what if?', follow-up questions, connections, discoveries or possible ideas this can generate or is already linked to</li><li>Connection to corresponding notes. There are two possible types of connections: 1) Index or entry-point link: These are high-level notes for a given topic that are the starting point for a deeper branching of related notes. 2) Note-to-note links: These references highlight lateral connections between individual notes.</li></ul><img class=\"images\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/blog-37b7c.appspot.com/o/zettelkasten.png?alt=media&token=36a5891b-acbc-4892-88fc-9e877df63a54\" alt=\"visual representation of the connection between notes\"/><p>With this general guideline, now we can approach the crux of this post: the implementation. You can easily start a Zettelkasten page in your Notion workplace with two databases, one for the Bibliography and one for the Slip Box. Each entry in the database will represent a 'card' with the properties listed above. However, rather than start from scratch I suggest using a template. After scouring through an absurd amount of resources, I gathered inspiration from four main sources - all listed at the bottom of this post. Of the four, I ended up using Hiran's, as it was the most well-structured and resourceful of the bunch. I just needed to adjust the properties slightly, but the connections between the databases were built already and his article outlining the process was incredibly helpful.</p><p>After finalizing the template, it took me a few months to transfer all of my notes to the Zettelkasten. In the beginning this went rather slowly. I was encouraging my brain to think of highlights I had made in a podcast in relation to other books, forming connections never previously recognized. It's been mesmerizing to see the collection of your consumption come together in a way that forms the building blocks for stronger mental models. You have <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://github.com/singhshemona/recommend\">a map of where your biases lie</a>. For example, while transferring my books it became clear that amongst my fiction reading, science-fiction is by far my most read category. They connect to articles and podcasts I had consumed long before that I never digested properly enough to realize these connections. What had otherwise felt like a patchy train of thought in regards to my own consciousness suddenly started to make sense. I realized why I held certain beliefs, and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://meltingasphalt.com/crony-beliefs/\">which ones were meritocratic vs crony</a>.</p><p>What made me perhaps the most excited when building out my second brain was where it could take the capabilities of my physical brain. I started observing visual representations of the gaps in my thinking. I could find two sources arguing for the same belief but in different ways, which source is more antifragile? I'm not alone in this excitement. There is a pressing wave of adoption for these tools of thought. What does this mean for the way people learn going forward? There are already tools like Anki and Readwise aiding memory, but connect this to the mental models you've formed in your Zettelkasten and you're an unstoppable rationality machine.</p><p>You may still be wondering what the point is in all of this. As a standalone system, the Zettelkasten is fantastic for building out your thoughts and becoming a more well-rounded intellectual. However, most of those who maintain a dynamic note-taking system like this are content creators. Whether they record podcasts, write blog posts or make YouTube videos, they have an interest in producing content for the public. For content creators, the Zettelkasten is a savior. It takes out the brunt of organizing because as you are adding notes you make the connections necessary to bring together a cohesive thesis. When it comes time to actually put together information for the medium of your choice, it's just a matter of pulling what you've already scripted. If you look more into the history of Zettelkasten, you'll know this was exactly what enabled inventor Niklas Luhmann into launching the 70+ books he did. The books were essentially already written within his note cards, where he did the most challenging part of his work. Then, he just needed to publish them.</p><p>If you're someone who wants to get started on producing content but don't know where to begin, maintaining a Zettelkasten will still benefit you. As it is a mirror of your mind, you can traverse these paths of thinking and see where your interests lead you. These areas are a great starting point for content. Teaching, drafting a skit, an analogy via cartooning, the possibilities are endless.</p><p>Lastly, if you're someone who might be thinking they don't want to create content for whatever reason, then I encourage you to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://boundless.substack.com/p/100-we-need-100x-more-creators-online\">respond to this plea</a>. Millerd breaks down the common misconceptions of sharing online but more importantly conveys that the world is your oyster if you only allow it to be. There are countless mediums in which one can produce in and even more platforms to publish on. If you have even more time, read <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7155145-linchpin?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=FiIAq7DPfi&rank=1\">Linchpin</a>. Godin will convince you of your gift and urge you to share it with the world.</p><p>In the meantime, start recording your thoughts with some intentional structure. If for no other reason than to form a more coherent worldview and be a beacon of rationality in an otherwise biased world.</p><p>-----</p><p>Here are the four templates I took inspiration from when applying the Zettelkasten principles in Notion:</p><ol><li><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.notion.so/Zettelkasten-Notion-1d0b1f7ad21841da846566bf17b81272\">Hiran's Slip Box</a> (the one I eventually used)</li><li><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.notion.so/shemona/Applying-Zettelkasten-to-Notion-99a40131644a4d9384a6be039f0db7e7#b630274fd1e14dc0a85e6d962aeefc29\">Reddit Zettelkasten</a></li><li><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.redgregory.com/notion/2020/9/20/zettelkasten-in-notion-and-how-i-use-its-principles\">Zettelkasten in Notion and Principles</a></li><li><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.notion.so/shemona/Applying-Zettelkasten-to-Notion-99a40131644a4d9384a6be039f0db7e7#ac19674ca5b14599a544c7dc83217db9\">Zettelkasten Template on Notion</a></li></ol>"

I do know that taking notes is something we're never taught. And like most activities associated with school (reading, writing, learning) we enthusiastically wipe our hands of them upon graduation.</p><p>It wasn't until last year I realized the repercussions of intentional note-taking. My understanding of material compounded when I put in the effort to make it my own. It quickly became evident that smart notes are the foundation of life-long learners.</p><p>Assuming school hasn't already beaten out your love of learning, you may enjoy consuming content of various mediums (podcasts, books, an online course). Maybe you're just fascinated by a subject or maybe you find the skills adjacent to  <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You-ebook/dp/B0076DDBJ6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3K1YESH2J60L3&dchild=1&keywords=so+good+they+cant+ignore+you&qid=1615916608&sprefix=so+good+they+%2Caps%2C161&sr=8-1\">building some career capital</a>. Whatever it is, typically consumption is the point at which engagement with material usually begins and ends. Granted, certain mediums (such as an online course) will be equipped with quizzes and assignments to test your retention. However, more often we consume and move on, leaving behind a breadth of uncharted insights.</p><p>Where does that leave us? One-liner book summaries we can regurgitate if the book comes up in conversation? For non-fiction reading in particular, authors must find this to be heartbreaking. If the knowledge you've accumulated isn't being applied past the point of consumption, if it's not helping you be a more compassionate, bayesian, and creative thinker, what's really the goal here?</p><p>We read to open our minds, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://shemonasingh.com/our-strongest-armor\">to feed our curiosity</a>. But when we don't take these new neural connections further, what is preventing the brain from decaying them out of neglect? Our interactions with them. This makes note-taking a natural ally to consumption due to its ability to create a context in which we can make the information our own. The Lindy Effect is the phenomenon that the longer a non-perishable has been around, the longer it is destined to be around. If an idea or invention has been around for 50 years, it will continue being around for 50 more years. When we create a dynamic context around our knowledge, The Lindy Effect show us we are increasing the life expectancy of our wisdom.</p><p>Before continuing, I must hedge with two key facts:</p><ol><li>Note-taking, if done frivolously, is worse than not taking notes at all. It becomes a distraction to your learning. You would save time not taking notes rather than taking them improperly.</li><li>Note-taking is a part of the larger process, it's not the final step. Engagement with material does not end at the result of your notes. I'll explain more about this later.</li></ol><p>With that clarification, I'd like to start by bringing technologist Andy Matuschak's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C\">Evergreen Notes</a> into the picture. I encourage you to visit the website, click on the embedded links in each note and read the tooltips. Notice how intuitive and delightful it comes across as. It feels very clear that this is an evolving system made with intention that has brought Matuschak a great deal of cognitive guidance.</p><p>These notes are a great introduction because they bring together the fundamental principles of smart note-taking. They are concise and well-connected. I can quickly gather the purpose of each note's recording as well as see how Matuschak's mind has formed its connections to other notes. It works so much like how our brain learns - conceptually and relatively.</p><p>I landed upon the Evergreen notes a while back, before being an avid note-taker. It instantly intrigued me, giving an idea of how boon it could be to life-long, active learning. So I set out to learn the fundamentals of note taking. My knowledge was heavily gathered from the book <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes\">How to Take Smart Notes</a>, a guide to forever changing the way you consume. I went through Mental Pivot's, Tiago Forte's, and Nat Eliason's (summary and guide) on How to Take Smart Notes (all linked below) and have gathered the only vital principles you need for better note taking:</p><ol><li>Use your own words. Be extremely selective with quotes. - taking notes does not equate to highlighting passages that stand out. Carrying over a few quotes with you that feel far too perfectly constructed is fine, but strive to use your own voice. In particular, don't stop at the highlighting of a quote. Ask why it stood out to you, what experience in your life does it connect to? What makes it worthy of a highlight?</li><li>The only criterion for what to save is whether it connects to existing ideas and adds to a thread of internal discussion - Focus on the connection. Doing so means both confirming and contradictory information to your beliefs are valuable for it will open new paths of inquiry in your mind. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://shemonasingh.com/finding-harmony-in-polarity\">Understand that new perspectives are an opportunity to expand your mental models, not an attack</a>. Note-taking is powerful for elaboration. Elaboration is the act of taking an idea, understanding its original context and then exploring its meaning and context in other ways. Consider follow-up questions to pursue. Practice asking counter-factual questions like “what if?”</li><li>Keep it very short. Write as if you were writing for someone else. - you may have come across the phrase 'atomic' in the context of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/\">design</a> or <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits\">habits</a>. Turns out, it's a great mental model for many other areas as well. Ensure that what you take note of is stripped away of any superfluous content. Many non-fiction books tend to be a few solid facts surrounded by miles of fluff - it's up to you to determine what the fluff is. When you write as if someone else will be reading it, it ensures that you are not destructively atomic to the point where the ability to gather meaning from your words is lost.</li></ol><p>Let's look at an example. The following is a quote I pulled from <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40603783-the-defining-decade\">The Defining Decade</a>, along with some notes showing how my mind played with the quote.</p><p class=\"quote\">Interviewers want to hear a reasonable story about the past, present, and future. How does what you did before relate to what you want to do now, and how might that get you to what you want to do next?</p><ul><li>What is my career story thus far? Am I on track to building a story towards the kind of influence I'd like to have? What kinds of activities outside of work are contributing to my career story - coding projects, technical blog, freelance web development. Are these leading me to become a better developer? Is being a better developer a short-term or long-term goal?</li></ul><p>Notice how the questions are open-ended, and consider connections to other parts of my life. The quote focuses on interviewers, but I also bring in my hobbies and wonder if those can help play a part. I've also journaled about my answers to these questions, so the thinking doesn't necessarily stop at the inquiry. I may pull this quote out specifically if I particularly love the way it's worded. But a sure way to solidify my understanding is to word it in a way that makes sense to my life. This quote also particularly resonated with me because I'm on the verge of crafting my career story. It made me pause to think about the relations I've built thus far, and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://shemonasingh.com/create\">which seeds I'm currently planting</a>.</p><p>Feel free to jot down your thoughts in the margins of a book, as notes to your kindle highlights, in a separate journal - it doesn't matter. As long as you have a way of immediately capturing and elaborating on what you're consuming. When thinking about how to take good notes, James Clear gives the following memorable insight in a previous newsletter:</p><p class=\"quote\">The trick to writing well is to take long sentences and make them short, take confusing ideas and make them clear, take unrelated concepts and make them related...without losing the main idea in the process.</p><p>Although this advice is targeted to writers, I'd argue it's also a great summary for taking smart notes - relate the concepts and make confusing ideas clear. Use note-taking as a way to play with the current connections in your mind and build new ones. This goes to the core of why I write - a analysis for a future blog post.</p><p>Once you have this collection of dissected notes, where to keep them? You don't want to just place them anywhere, because that will result in you likely never coming back to them and the book again disappearing from your thought patterns. You want to store them in an efficient and retrievable manner. How to do so will be discussed in my next post, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://shemonasingh.com/applying-zettelkasten-to-notion\">Applying Zettelkasten to Notion</a>. There is where we will learn about what it means to have a 'second brain' and apply new meaning to our findings.</p>    <p>-----</p><p>These were the guides I walked through that then led me to summarizing all my findings into the 3 key points above.

Regardless of how refined that perspective might be, it's overwhelming. What's right, what's wrong and what's best for you is preached by millions of strangers on various platforms.</p><p>There are countless reasons America's headstrong culture has brought the economy to the global powerhouse it is today, but it comes with an overlooked sacrifice. The success of capitalism is reliant on the suffering of it's citizens. If people are fulfilled and grateful, there is little spending or consumption on any level. If there is less consumed, there is less to capitalize. The most self-aware people I know are the worst candidates for a successful American economy. The ideal candidate is anxious, on medication, going to therapy, chasing vanity and has generally low self-esteem. Why? They're contributing back to economy with their money, time, health, and happiness. </p><p>Author Johann Hari has done research into this bizarre setup. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/johann_hari_this_could_be_why_you_re_depressed_or_anxious?language=en\">In a TED Talk discussing his results</a> he questions his professor, \"If we know that valuing money or being vain is not sustainable why do we do these things?\" After some thought his professor responded, \"because we live in a machine that is designed to neglect what is important about life.\"</p><p>We've built a world in which it's in a marketers best interest to create self-doubt so that companies can profit off of our uninformed, insecure self-esteems. Look at any advertisement. It essentially boils down to an attempt to convince you of your incompleteness. Some translation of: 'you can be better-looking and attract more mates if you do xyz to your face', or 'you'll appear more successful and valuable to your friends if you take part in this'. When you're persuaded of lacking __(insert trait valuable to society)__, it can feel as though you have something to 'fix', something to 'fill', something that's 'missing'. These empty desires are the perfect time for companies to swoop in and offer 'solutions'.</p><p>When you were born, there were 0 expectations. You lived and played in the ways that made you happy - that was enough. Why would there be a point in life where all of a sudden your value depleted? That point only exists in your head. You are a whole, unbroken, completed and capable individual. You have what you need beneath the stigmas and limiting beliefs to be unlearned. You may need to take the journey to reach this state of clarity, but you weren't incomplete when you started. The biggest failure of American culture is making you feel like somehow your value chipped away as you got older, and the only way to re-polish the cracks are with your money, health and time.</p><p>Once you're on board with this conclusion, how do take that journey? What can we do in the face of billion dollar factories aimed at puppeteering our every desires?</p><p>These are questions Tristan Harris of The Social Dilemma and author Yuval Noah Harari have pondered for years. They are at the forefront of this discussion, warning whomever will listen about the powerful developments of AI embedded in social media apps. These programs understand how to stroke our every primal desire. An interviewer asked them both how might someone avoid technology from manipulating them. Harari responded, \"Get to know yourself much better, and have as little illusions about yourself as possible. If a desire pops up in your mind, don't just say 'this is my free will, this is good, I should do it,' explore much deeper.\"</p><p>This response is similar to one that is given to a question often asked to those with many years of experience: \"What advice would you give your younger self?\" This is quite a heavy question. It can make the person being interviewed feel as they have the responsibilities of a generation's future to bear. But, after much thought most end up digging up the simplest one or two line summary of their life's learnings. And many of those lines, I have noticed, revolve around one theme. A theme that addresses my previous question of fighting against the feeling of not being enough:</p><p>Be ruthlessly curious.</p><p>That is, curious in examining yourself. Not in a self-care, 'treat yourself' kind of way, but in a 'face your demons' kind of way. Understanding how / why you are the way you are and evaluating the quality of your mind. Build a holistic world view of what it means to live at peace with yourself and with others.</p><p>This assessment requires freedom from judgment. When asked to name a quality that can make one an especially poor thinker, writer Philip Tetlock said \"Dogmatism - that is, an unshakable belief they know something to be true even when they don't.\" The opposite of dogmatism is wonder. There are countless means of wondering. Some like to wonder with long walks, some with journaling, some with meditation, some with therapy. These means are fantastic for exploring the weeds of your mind that have been developed up until that point. An even more difficult but necessary means of wondering is in the daily, moment-to-moment seconds that you feel any impulses, desires, drives. In the fun sci-fy adventure What the Hell Did I Just Read?, main character David Wong says:</p><p class=\"quote\">For it is in this moment - the moment in between feeling an impulse and succumbing to it - that you actually exist.</p><p>Each day provides you with countless opportunities to recognize and act upon an impulse. If you react to certain situations instantly with the same emotions, ask yourself why did this comment, behavior or situation stir up these feelings? What is it about this situation that gives it the power to disturb your peace?</p><p>In the No-Nonsense Buddhism for Beginners, Noah Rasheta gives us a quick series of questions to ask ourselves in these moments: \"You are made up of form, sensation, perception, mental formations/thoughts, consciousness. Pick apart why you are feeling a certain emotion. Bring yourself to awareness by asking yourself:\"</p><ol><li>Where am I?</li><li>What am I doing?</li><li>What did it take for this moment to arise?</li></ol><p>This is easier said than done of course, and is an ongoing journey. There will likely never be a point in your life where you feel you've conquered your impulses. But the way that you know you're on the right path? It'll be extremely uncomfortable. You're basically needing to go against the ancient wirings of your brain. Examining yourself and asking the questions I mentioned in the heat of a moment or even afterwards will feel like an uphill battle in the face of countless distractions. There are so many bandaids to apply to our confused wounds, that these examinations can feel cumbersome. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://youtu.be/HV1uEEHrT5U?t=170\">But don't let perfect get in the way of good.</a> On any journey where the end does not justify the means, you want to aim for consistency over perfection. Small but noticeable changes that show you some sense of progress.</p><p>Curiosity is the fever that has ricocheted our species to the present. The ability to entertain a perspective of life other than the ones glued to your eyes is plausible with our apps providing a telescope into other worlds. These differences have ended lives in more conservative periods of humanity, but it has also brought vital changes to our tools. Overall, there is strong encouragement to live by one's own moral compass and not suffer through values that feel foreign. 'Be curious' is not new advice, though it is certainly timeless.</p><p>Perhaps however, it is needed to be reminded of now more than ever. In <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/28-two-million-years-in-two-hours-a-conversation-with-yuval-noah-harari\">Two Million Years in Two Hours</a> from Your Undivided Attention, Harris gives a one-line summary of why most of the suffering of today's world exists.</p><p class=\"quote\">We have Paleolithic minds, medieval institutions, and god-like technology</p><p>There is one aspect of this I'd like to highlight: the 'Paleolithic minds.' Our largely archaic minds have been alluded to in countless mediums, whether in a stand-up special to describe cringe-worthy behavior or in a sociology paper outlining emotional developments of married couples. These primal drives of ours is clearly not new information to many. And while I agree with it in many cases, this consensus has bothered me in one regard: The lack of agency humans seem to be allowed. Yes, we don't have a choice in whether we feel an emotion, but we do have the awareness and the capabilities to act on those emotions.</p><p>In Harari's follow-up to Sapiens, Homo Deus, he contemplates free-will. Particularly in the role of our emotions. He points out how neural events in the brain that will then influence decisions tend to begin a few hundred milliseconds to a few seconds before the person is even aware of them. With this knowledge, exercising free-will in regards to what we feel does not seem viable. We don't choose what we feel. But the key is the next step. We do choose how we act accordingly. Harari continues to write:</p><p class=\"quote\">Some of those voices repeat society’s prejudices, some echo our personal history, and some articulate our genetic legacy. [Together they] create an invisible story that shapes our conscious decisions in ways we seldom grasp.</p><p>This realization is powerful. At least to the degree that it should place responsibility on the Paleolithic mind to unlearn what the medieval institutions taught it and to use our god-like technology to advance its thinking, not stunt it. It doesn't do much good to build on the narrative of today's humans being the lost puppies of history that are needing to be appeased by our tools. Rather, we should question how we might upgrade our thinking patterns to not play into our impulses. As it had been pointed out in author David Wong's book earlier - we focus on the moment between the stimuli and our reaction.</p><p>Capitalism does a fantastic job of playing on the imposter syndrome of feeling human. It's constantly reminding us we are missing something or broken in some way. We may placate these perceived wounds with modern day pacifiers posing as comforts. If desire is the root of all suffering (according to essentially every Buddhist literature) then our media and advertising industries are destroying any chance of feeling content.</p><p>Imposter syndrome is something that is discussed at almost every tech conference, but the feeling isn't exclusive to techies. If you've ever progressed in a field, you've likely felt it. To those accustomed to hearing about it in regards to a skillset, it might seem strange to consider it in the framing of self-awareness. The imposter syndrome of capitalism plays upon the feeling of being a fraud of a being. A feverish curiosity helps to avoid the pitfalls of this form of imposter syndrome. A quote by Caroline Caldwell summarizes the connection:</p><p class=\"quote\">In a world that profits off of self-doubt, liking yourself is a rebellious act</p><p>Up until now I've focused on understanding yourself and being curious. I haven't exactly specified where to channel this energy. You could very well be curious on a road that won't contribute back to your thinking. But the curiosity, the level of self-awareness and responsibleness that I'm referring to is one that builds the mental models you need in life to maintain peace. Decision-making frameworks that allow you to be thrusted into the miseries of life with the mental agility to understand what is in your power to change.</p><p>Once you've allocated time for these developments, consider the greatest gift you can give to someone else: your presence. In the modern world, everything is competing for your attention. In a world run by media, you have to decide who and what deserves your time. As your journey continues, your attention's filter will also strengthen. You'll have a better idea of the kinds of stimuli that fuel you and those that drain you.</p><p>Look at life as a canvas that never reaches completion. You have an imperative duty to edit this canvas in the direction towards what defines a masterpiece for you. Dive into various pioneers of rationality and develop your moral compass. Be mercilessly curious about picking yourself apart. Don't allow your mindset to be an accident of history, but a product of intentional cultivation. Have an insatiable hunger for feedback and improvement. What are your north stars of work, relationships, hobbies? What does growth look like to you? It could be giving yourself the day off, it could be finally updating your resume to continue the job hunt or it could be parting ways with a toxic friendship. It's different for everyone but the journey is to understand, reflect and adapt. I am reminded of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air\">Paul Kalanithi's paraphrasing</a> of the Graham Greene quote: \"life is lived in the first twenty years and the remainder is just reflection.\"</p><p>How will you reflect?</p>"

      "content": "<p class=\"thesis\">Question upon the narratives we live out our days on - which ones are hindering us, which ones enhance us?</p><p>We all tell ourselves stories everyday, about everyone and everything around us. These stories can be referred to as narratives.</p><p>They are so embedded in the root of our ways, so subconscious, we often aren't even aware we function according to them. They are not necessarily mental models so much as they are the instinctive ways we explain the world and its happenings to our brains. Because they influence our instincts, they feed the everyday reactions we have and determine the vibrations we reverberate.</p><p>We can at any point learn a new narrative, but much of our lives are lived according to the narratives handed to us. There is nothing to point a finger at here. We inherit narratives per chance from our environments, our cultures, and the people we are most exposed to. Narratives around our relationship with financial sustainability are often inherited, in subtle ways like how much one was taught to save or thinks they even need to save.</p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Think-Like-Freak-Authors-Freakonomics/dp/0062218344/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=think+like+a+freak&qid=1609538410&sr=8-1\">In Think Like a Freak</a>, Stephen J. Dubner and Steven Levitt state \"contemporary behaviors are driven by root causes from centuries past.\" It's hard to really draw a line back to the point where some thoughts derive, often it's connected to a part of our primal nature. They give an example of how some Italian towns are more likely to participate in philanthropic programs because during the Middle Ages these towns were free city-states rather than ruled by normal overlords. A ruling so long ago that deeply affected one generation can pass their charitable narratives (or lack thereof) down to so many after them.</p><p>The most interesting connection I find is between narratives and incentives. There are shared incentives we all have, but our narratives can change based on what we consider to be an incentive. Reaching some personal sense of financial security is a reality we can all agree upon to be an incentive, but the ways in which we consider that need for security met varies greatly. The extent to which a narrative is colored with the incentive of money varies immensely from person to person, and can change with what degree money is a driving force.</p><p>Incentives can lead us to continue habits we've already familiarized ourselves with or push us into creating change. What can lead us down the path of change rather than one of the familiar? Changing the narrative. To quote James Clear from his <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1\">3, 2, 1 newsletter</a>:</p><p class=\"quote\">When people say they don’t want to change what they really mean is they don’t have an incentive to change. Change the incentives and the behavior follows suit.</p><p>For many of us, this quote could probably summarize 2020. So many companies went about major changes in their organizational structures and daily processes - an undertaking that would have been impossible without the pressure of little choice and time powering the incentive to remain profitable. Perhaps the strongest ability of humans - <a class=\"link\" href=\"shemonasingh.com/finding-harmony-in-polarity\">the ability to adapt</a> - is what has brought us here. While certain incentives will never change, the priorities of our species have adapted throughout the years, as they do with any individual in a given lifetime.</p><p>The most fascinating aspect of it all? How often our incentives can be so deeply rooted that our drive for them begins to impact areas of our life we would have never accounted for. This can be healthy or destructive. We can be driven by money enough to ensure our families are well fed or we can idolize wealth to the degree that we lose sleep over 'never having enough'.</p><p>This intriguing relationship of outcome and incentive can sometimes make one wonder how an outcome could have possibly resulted from the incentive. James Clear talks more about this on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/james-clear-401/\">The Rich Roll Podcast</a>. He explains how some of the most effective behavior change apps actually change behavior through a trap door. His example? Pokemon Go.</p><p>The minds behind Pokemon Go never sat down to ask how might they get people to go outside, get fresh air, and get their steps in. But, the app does all of that. This bizarre outcome is one that user's aren't even playing for. Their true incentive is to 'catch 'em all', and in doing so Pokemon Go changed the narrative of exercise. It doesn't have to be something you schedule in routinely in a given day. Rather, they brought it back to the days when most of a human's day consisted of labor. The concept of 'working out' didn't even need to exist because staying active was just such a natural part of one's day.</p><p>The most uplifting part of the conversation is when Clear brings back this message of 'trap doors' to the dreamers who want to make an impact:</p><p class=\"quote\">I think there’s something here for people who do have good intentions, who want to change the world in a positive way. Think about what those trap doors are. What are things that actually motivate people? Saving money, making money, getting a high score, winning approval. If you can think about how to have a secondary healthy behavior happening as they do that, that might actually be something that sticks and gets millions of people to actually do that.</p><p>These trap doors are so powerful, on the hunt for your next idea it's worth seeking what they could be. In what ways can you change the narrative of the field you're interested in impacting to naturally stimulate behavior change?</p><p>A similar conversation was held on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://tim.blog/2020/09/02/chuck-palahniuk/\">The Tim Ferris Show with Chuck Palahunick.</a> I was listening to gain some tips for my writing style and unexpectedly walked away with a deeper understanding of how our society works. Ferris asked Palahunick rather shyly if there were ways literature could bring about change in society, a question he assumed Palahunick has been asked to contemplate often. To which Palahunick eagerly responded with a resounding 'yes':</p><p class=\"quote\">People think that the arts don't really create social change but when they change the narrative they just change what people perceive as valuable or high status then they naturally get people to change without having to browbeat people or legislate change.</p><p>He then further strengthened his argument by providing the audience with two examples of social change occurring as a result of a simple change of narrative.</p><ul><li>Beavers were almost driven to extinction at one point because beaver hats were quite fashionable. Then the British came out with silk top hats and those became the new fashion statement. All of sudden no one wanted Beaver hats so the Beaver population reached a point of normalcy again.</li><li>Italian Fur Industry - Fur used to be only for the rich. One day the industry came up with an idea for poorer folks to afford fur - allow them to finance it, similar to how you might finance a home. It was a success so now the poor started wearing fur. Alas, the rich saw the poor started wearing fur and out of this loss of 'exclusive status' surrounding fur, the rich stopped wearing fur. Then the poor saw the rich stopped wearing fur, and now deemed it to no longer have its 'prestige status' so the poor stopped wearing fur. To this day, the fur industry has never completely recovered.</li></ul><p>Ferris then added an additional example involving pigeons. At one point, pigeons used to be considered 'display' birds for aristocracy, only the wealthy could afford them. Then one day they got out and ended up multiplying very well. Their over-abundance quickly turned their reputation into 'trash' birds and are now often seen as an annoyance to many, particularly in larger cities.</p><p>The beaver's inherent value never changed, neither did fur's or the pigeons. All that changed around them were the narratives we pedaled which in turn determined their value. Upon hearing these stories is really when the power of narratives struck a chord. There have been many times I acted in a way due to a narrative I believed in so profoundly, to the point where it became difficult to imagine another way of acting. However, simple things such as time passing, a graduation to a new period of life and varied experiences have shifted some narratives my internal dialogue had so fervently recited at a time.</p><p>Realizing how deeply subconscious narratives can become and how they can play out in automated behaviors shows the power of narratives in our lives. Because of this, it's worth checking in with ourselves regularly and asking:</p><ul><li>What narratives might I act upon regularly?</li><li>Which of those narratives do I hold true so deeply that it may be difficult to recognize their magnetism in my thoughts?</li><li>Which ones have the heaviest impact on my decision-making?</li><li>Might there be ones which letting go would remove some mental chains?</li></ul><p>Narratives are a fantastic way for our brain to perform heuristically, without having to burden itself with the mental grunt work of consistently approaching a situation as if you had never experienced it before. If we are aware of these narratives and let them empower our decisions rather than mindlessly control them, we can design our lives freely.</p>"

Our tribes are the groups of people that for centuries humans have relied on to ensure themselves that they are sane, and in fact it's everyone else who has lost it. Discovering this connection is vital to our fulfillment, but the formulaic, predictable paths the internet now leads us down has lead our thinking in the same direction. In <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1594485380/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_JI88FbSHAGG13\">Where Good Ideas Come From</a>, Steven Johnson  reminisces of the time when physical newspapers were a common investment. The beauty of the physical newspaper was that it created an architecture of serendipity, by forcing you to look through other sections before you reach the sections you're interested in. Similar to the days of exploring a library with maybe a few questions in mind and being pleasantly surprised with what you find. Johnson concludes by saying, \"The links that arrive on our screen are not serendipity - they are group-think, everything we need to know comes filtered and vetted. We are discovering what everyone else is learning, and usually from people we have selected because they share our tastes.\" Cal Newport discusses this topic in greater detail on the Deep Questions podcast (episode 58?) where he coins the term 'intellectual groupie-ism.'</p><p class=\"quote\">I think a lot of what we see on social media is basically what I call intellectual groupie-ism. Like, I don’t want to do the work, someone else tell me the cliffs notes. What are the basic ideas we all agree with, and more importantly, what’s good and what’s bad, and what do I do to make sure I do the good thing and not the bad thing? like great, I’m with it. And now I’m going to, with great fervor, push this philosophy, but there is nothing below it. You haven’t read any of the things, you haven’t done the hard reading, you haven’t confronted the criticism, you haven’t read the alternative and let that collide and then let your roots grow deep. On social media you are often just a groupie for intellectuals, and say, “I just trust you. Just give me the cliffs notes I need, because I just want to go around with your metaphorical jam band and make sure I have bootleg tapes from your concerts…” We don’t do this anymore – we don’t build philosophies from scratch, we don’t go to the sources. Social media says “don’t bother with that. In fact, if you do bother with it, we might yell at you, so just come on, we will just give you the cliffs notes.”</p><p>Intellectual groupie-ism has also led to what I've noticed to be a subtle but toxic competition: A battle of who is the most 'woke'. Everyday, whether online or in-person, the space for patience and understanding in a discussion involving differing opinions seems to grow slimmer by the day. Tensions feel higher than ever, and fingers are constantly being pointed with labels like politically incorrect, sexist, racist, etc.</p><p>The clincher is, being 'woke' can depend on factors you don't even have control over. Pinning everyone to a personalized standard of being culturally aware is comparing apples to oranges. If you take two people on this planet, regardless of their relationship, they are so fundamentally different in ways like their internal dialogue, defense mechanisms, and cultural upbringing. All of this and so much more has to do with being 'woke'. Even so, if a fact is not in their realm of knowledge, it likely will be the thing they get called out on. In <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://youtu.be/NIxJxxM6BCM?t=307\">a fantastic interview, Jameela Jamil says</a>:</p><p class=\"quote\">If we completely cut people down every time they show their ignorance or they make a mistake then people are going to feel like there's no value in learning or progressing because you're punished forever for the sin that you no longer stand by<p><p>\"For the sin that you no longer stand by\" - This is the part that stood out to me the most. We've all said things, done things we're not particularly proud of but what social media has enabled is for everyone else to have a keepsake of those moments. Regardless of whether that person has developed beyond that point, it's as if to everyone else their life is paused on that moment. When we constantly bring people down, criticize them, call them out, then no one is going to feel comfortable to express themselves or be open to learning. In creating this environment we are going against the most critical evolutionary necessity, to adapt. It was Darwin himself who said, \"It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change\". We are only where we are because we’ve been able to make mistakes and improve from them.</p><p>This is by no means an argument to excuse poor behavior. But, there is a way to address what bothers you politely, with an invitation to a conversation in learning more. There is also a difference between intentional bigotry and innocent curiosity. Identifying the difference can be done only through communication, by recognizing that what you feel personally attacked by might not necessarily be a 'blanket' offense to everyone's sensitivities. James Clear provides an excellent mantra for navigating this: \"To simplify before you understand the details is ignorance. To simplify after you understand the details is genius.\" If you attempt to form conclusions of topics you're already unfamiliar with to begin with, you run the risk of falling into that sensitive area. When you've done your research and you're familiar with the ins and outs of a topic of conversation, that's when it can be helpful, not harmful, to others in providing your overarching insights.</p><p>Aristotle is credited to have said, \"It is the sign of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it\". Kevin Kelly hat tips to Aristotle in one of many nuggets of wisdom he dishes out in his blog post titled <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/\">68 bits of unsolicited advice</a> The very first one states:</p><p class=\"quote\">Learn how to learn from those you disagree with, or even offend you. See if you can find the truth in what they believe.<p><p>In a discussion between Kelly and Host Stephen J. Dubner on Freakonomics podcast episode <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://freakonomics.com/podcast/kevin-kelly/\">68 Ways to Be Better at Life</a>, Kelly further elaborates on this advice:</p><p class=\"quote\">There are parts of my books where I’ve written something, and somebody will say something very strong, “That’s dumb,” or it’s stupid, or wrong. And that’s pretty harsh. But my take is to say, “Let me see if there’s any truth to that.” Sometimes there’s not. Sometimes there may be some sliver of something. And what I’ve learned to do is to respond to that little sliver. To try to get underneath why they’re saying it and where is it they’re coming from. I don’t have to necessarily always agree with them or change it, but I have to pay attention to that signal. And so I’ve learned to treat these things as signals rather than as insults.<p><p>Signals rather than insults. This is the north star of living a less triggered life. When seemingly negative energy arises, reactions can be viewed as a signal, an invitation to learn more about yourself or anyone else involved. Then, adapt future conversations and behaviors accordingly.</p><p>If you watched Jamil's interview, you will see she calls herself a \"feminist in progress.\" This mentality of ongoing development can be applied to all of us. To the layers of our identities, we are all a version of them in progress. No one is or eventually reaches a realm of moral purity fully encompassing what they believe in. Morals are a compass, not a map. And by being on a self-righteous high horse, you’re in fact being the opposite of the educated, 'woke' individual you claim yourself to be - you’re being stubborn.  This reminder can welcome thought-provoking discussions, but more importantly humble us all when tensions arise.</p>"

This is the same reason why the timing of when you read a particular book can be imperative to your development, or why so many applications use algorithms in an attempt to tailor content to what they think you need most in that time. This is what happened when I came across a video titled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz4YqwH_6D0&feature=youtu.be\" class=\"link\">The Toolbox Fallacy</a>. I had heard of similar concepts in my early college years and saved it as a mental note to come back to later. I wasn't particularly infatuated with it then but I had a feeling the message being conveyed was something I may need to hear later in life.</p><p>And that's exactly what happened. Recently, Youtube recommended the video again. The thumbnail sparked the mental note I had made to return to it, so I hit play.</p><p>Never did a set of words resonate so strongly.</p><p>Before you continue reading, I'd suggest watching it first and reading through some of the top comments to get an idea of it's premise. If not just for the fact that it might be exactly what you need to hear as well.</p><p>The video suggests that in order to truly embody the identity of xyz-skilled person you claim yourself to be, you must consistently be producing work appropriate to the nature of that skill. A writer writes. A dancer dances. An active person doesn't allow their body to be stagnant for too long. This seems obvious, but that's where the idea of a 'toolbox' comes in. It can be easy to trick your brain into thinking you're still working according to that identity you claim yourself to be but not actually improve over time. Instead, you fill your toolbox with articles you've read, other people's work you admire, items you've purchased for said skill or anything else that makes you feel as if that part of your identity is still there. But in reality you're hoarding a toolbox of potential.</p><p>This fallacy is particularly relevant in today's information era. The DIKW pyramid explains the relationships between data, information, knowledge and wisdom - in particular how content passes through those phases.</p><img class=\"images\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/blog-37b7c.appspot.com/o/create.png?alt=media&token=d3872992-5c66-445a-8b50-6103a99b231a\" /><p>We are more overloaded then ever before with data that is then being churned out into information. However, the path from information to knowledge has not been ventured on to the degree of the path from data to information.</p><p>This leaves us buried with content and not enough sense of it. In other words, we have endless amounts of information to fill our toolboxes with. The fallacy plays against us when we don't use what we've gathered in our toolboxes to develop our own knowledge and sharpen our wisdom. If you tell yourself you are a painter, but it's been 3 years and within that time you've comforted yourself by buying a canvas, buying a few books on painting and watching some painters perform their magic all while not having actually painted much, you're victim to the Toolbox Fallacy.</p><p>One of the most awful aspects of the fallacy? It blinds you from time passing.</p><p>This is why learning of the Toolbox Fallacy at the time that I did particularly stuck with me. It felt like a slap in the face. Starting as early as college (but particularly after graduation) the hobbies, interests, and pastimes that once ignited me in a way where I couldn't imagine separating from them, ended up taking a backseat to other priorities we're told through time need to be elevated.</p><p>My sister recently shared a quote with me that summed this up well:</p><p class=\"quote\">A dancer dies twice - once when they stop dancing, and this first death is the more painful. - Martha Graham</p><p>As someone who grew up constantly expressing myself in artistic ways to the point where even imagining myself in the technical field I'm in today was unthinkable, I veered so far from how I loved spending my time as a child. I was an avid sketcher, writer, scrapbooker, drawer, and dancer. If left with no oversight, I'd naturally gravitate to spending my time doing something along those lines. A question I often ask myself now is: \"If your younger self saw your life today, what about it would make them happy and what would make them sad?\"</p><p>The Toolbox Fallacy showed me how blindsided my younger self would be. She would be proud of how far I've come in my field, but appalled with how I've unintentionally left behind so much of who I was.</p><p>Throughout college I reminded myself the time for those miscellaneous hobbies that made me happy when I was younger will come. They'll come when I know what I want to do, or maybe they'll come when I get an internship? Or how about a job? Enough time passed where I was unsure I could still allow myself to identity as the creative I once was. I had fallen into, as the narrator says, \"the person I became while I was waiting to start my life.\"</p><p>It's tempting to fall into the excuse of not having the 'right conditions' to start. But the truth is, no one began great, <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/benjamin-p-hardy/want-to-become-the-best-at-what-you-do-read-this.html\" class=\"link\">there is very little that talent has to do with the art of crafting a skill</a>. You can build a skill, by not letting it leave your side, irrespective of any prerequisites you think you may or may not meet. There is beauty in the repetitive nature of sharpening a knife - of observing yourself grow at a craft you may have found daunting initially but can now intuitively understand which strings your fingers should land on to play that song or effortlessly hold a conversation in a foreign language.</p><p>This desire to build, to perfect a craft, to improve at a skill - it's deeply rooted within all of us. It's this very essence of our DNA that has enabled us to evolve so far, to create environments where we can thrive.</p><p>A few months back a weekly newsletter linked me to Marc Andreessen's essay, <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/\" class=\"link\">It's Time to Build</a>. I would recommend reading the entire essay, but there was one paragraph that struck me the hardest:</p><p class=\"quote\">Every step of the way, to everyone around us, we should be asking the question, what are you building? What are you building directly, or helping other people to build, or teaching other people to build, or taking care of people who are building? If the work you’re doing isn’t either leading to something being built or taking care of people directly, we’ve failed you, and we need to get you into a position, an occupation, a career where you can contribute to building. There are always outstanding people in even the most broken systems — we need to get all the talent we can on the biggest problems we have, and on building the answers to those problems.</p><p>In school, we provide solutions we are taught to provide and create work that must fit within the fixed constraints of an assignment. This can fail many into passive thinking - thinking that doesn't fare well when faced with questions that haven't been answered or problems that need ingenious solutions.</p><p>When taking action towards building or crafting - no matter how small - it plants a seed. It waters the buds of the interests and curiosities that are already hungry, waiting for nourishment. With certain continued habits the flowers, or parts of our identities we once felt were thriving, can even be uprooted. An identity that you desire to nurture could even feel irrelevant if ignored for too long. What could learning how to read sheet music have to do with my job as a software developer? The connections may seem far fetched and rather forced now, but I guarantee something is there. If not in the skill itself, but perhaps the way the skill forces your hands to move, be in tune to a certain sound, or how your brain must learn to think in an environment it has never been tested in before. All things that can translate to benefit other parts of your identity. In the beginning however, the motivation may be just to remind yourself of the amazement of building - that it is an art on its own.</p><p>Of course, passive thinking can be necessary to move the needle. James Clear differentiates the two as Motion and Action. Motion being the steps taken to set yourself up for action. He provides some helpful examples in his recent newsletter:</p><p>Goal: Start working out</p><ul><li>Motion: Talk to a personal trainer</li><li>Action: Do 10 squats</li></ul><p>Goal: Write a book</p><ul><li>Motion: Research your book idea</li><li>Action: Write 1 sentence</li></ul><p>Goal: Meditate regularly</p><ul><li>Motion: Explore different types of meditation</li><li>Action: Meditate for 1 minute</li></ul><p>He concludes by saying: \"Motion feels like progress. Action is progress.\"</p><p>Although certain motions to build a new skill are imperative, it can be easy to fall into the 'research mode' of a habit and not actually begin to produce anything of your own. I've been there many times, and have habitually begun to check on what specific goals my actions in the day are contributing towards.</p><p>I suppose the appropriate parting thought for this essay would be a question. A question that poses as a reminder, one to bring up frequently throughout life.</p><p>What are you building?</p>"

I wasn't quite sure where its relevance was to my Computer Science major but it peaked my curiosity and that was valuable enough. As I grew to enjoy the work Digital Arts classes required of me as much as (if not more) than what my Computer Science classes assigned, I was committed to figuring out a possible intersection between the two for my career. There is an evolving, exhilarating world that exists where design meets technology, and I was determined to be a part of it.</p><p>Towards the start of my 2nd year at College I came across a mental model in perceiving knowledge. I can't remember if it was a video, an article or an image, but this image captures the concept well:</p><img class=\"images\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/blog-37b7c.appspot.com/o/liquid-thinking.png?alt=media&token=50f0750b-9823-455d-adbf-451dd3158937\" alt=\"what we know and don't know grid\" /><p>Around this time I naturally began thinking of knowledge as a network, and exposure to this image encouraged further exploration towards that form of thinking. I envisioned every field of knowledge (e.g. farming, computers, interior design) as a 'network,' whereby lay a universe of knowledge waiting to be discovered. Within the network there would be 'nodes,' or broader topics within that field that had their own networks. The connections formed between nodes generated the network, or overarching representation of that field's knowledge.</p><p>The connections wouldn't just stop at that field's network, however. Fields always connected to each other somehow, in some way. Farming to computers, interior design to mental health. Whether it seemed apparent from how much of a network's knowledge you were familiar with, there were connections. There could be similarities in the ways of problem solving, in the areas of the world it impacted, in the audiences entertaining that information or more. I found that recognizing these connections made stepping into new networks, or territories of knowledge, less intimidating and in fact more intuitive. It was when I could apply the detailed muscle memory I gained over years of dance lessons to my yoga practice, which then powered the steadiness of hand-eye coordination I needed when painting, strengthening my patience and creativity when baking a new wildly creative recipe in return supercharging the algorithmic problem solving nature needed for troubleshooting code that I came to realize how connected networks can be. Particularly networks that I once thought were isolated pillars, when in fact it is their coming together that form the building of my identity.</p><p>Towards the beginning of this year, once working from home provided me ample time to explore my curiosities, this idea came up again increasingly throughout books, articles, podcasts and other miscellaneous forms of content in bizarrely similar ways.</p><p>It began when I started reading <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1455508373/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_6N88FbNHCHJXS\" class=\"link\">The One World Schoolhouse</a> by Sal Khan, where he outlines a much needed restructuring of America's education system. A quote I'd like to bring to light is from his discussions of putting an end to the 'Swiss Cheese Learning' we do in school:</p><p class=\"quote\">Genetics is taught in biology while probability is taught in math, even though one is really an application of the other. Physics is a separate class from algebra and calculus despite its being a direct application of them. Chemistry is partitioned off from physics even though they study many of the same phenomena at different levels. All of these divisions limit understanding and suggest a false picture of how the universe actually works. Wouldn't students find it useful to understand how contact forces (studied in physics) are in fact an expression of the repulsive forces between electrons (studied in chemistry)? Wouldn’t algebra seem a tad more interesting if it could also be used to figure out how fast you hit the water on a belly flop or how heavy you would be on a planet twice Earth's mass? For that matter, think about the interesting cross-pollination that might occur if a value-neutral subject like computer science were studied together with a value-laden subject like evolution; what might students learn by writing computer programs to simulate variation and competition in an ecosystem?</p><p>Khan brings together different networks to emphasize the far-reaching, fascinatingly perplexing ways we can think and apply our knowledge. It's in these spaces of convergence, these points where the nodes from two seemingly unrelated networks meet that stretches our mind to another dimension. The allusion to this concept of <a href=\"http://members.aect.org/edtech/ed1/24/24-07.html\" class=\"link\">everything being part of a greater whole</a> instantly brought me back to that mental model I had started developing in my college brain. At this point, I had an idea of why this type of model wasn't obvious in my earlier years of schooling - the separation of subjects, tossed in with the pressure of deadlines made this formative thinking irrelevant.</p><p>This essay revolves around the concept of 'liquid.' The definition of this word expanded for me whilst completing another quarantine book, <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1594485380/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_JI88FbSHAGG13\" class=\"link\">Where Good Ideas Come From</a> By Steven Johnson. He advocates for systems that foster a 'liquid' dissemination of information rather than in a 'solid' (traditional) or 'gaseous' (chaotic) way because of the promising, fertile environment they create to explore possibilities. 'Liquid' environments are breeding grounds for innovation. When a system is too 'solid', things can feel bureaucratic, rigid, or adverse to change. For environments that harbor a 'gaseous' culture it's hard to be productive due to the disorganization and lack of communication or any sense of network formation.</p><p>As per the title of the book, he further explains how bringing this 'thinking in networks' to your personal life will result in fruitful ideation:</p><p>A good idea is a network - a specific constellation of neurons fire in sync with each other for the first time and an idea pops into your consciousness...To be more innovative, you have to place yourself inside environments that share that same network signature - networks of ideas/people that mimic the neural networks of a mind exploring the boundaries of the <a href=\"http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/09/28/the-adjacent-possible.html\" class=\"link\">adjacent possible</a> And so, from this book is where I speculated the term 'liquid thinking': a thought process that involves factoring in various networks of knowledge in an attempt to gain an intuitive understanding of a topic</p><p>Over at Ness Labs liquid thinking has been discussed for some time, coined differently in a fantastic article as <a href=\"https://nesslabs.com/thinking-in-maps\" class=\"link\">Thinking in Maps</a>. In it, Anne-Laure Le Cunff cites Leonardo Da Vinci as a master of 'visual thinking,' having over 13,000 pages of notes combining drawings of art and philosophy via interconnected webs. In discussion of Da Vinci's work, Cunff quotes art historian Martin Kemp: \"One of the characteristics you will find of polymaths is that they see links where we see separations—for Leonardo everything is linked up.\"</p><p>Links where we see separations. This is a muscle worth strengthening consistently. It's in these seemingly happenstance links that creative, eccentric work emerges. Emerged from areas that may have seemed too distant for a mind unable to bridge a separation. Da Vinci, understanding the necessity of liquid thinking for a life of deep art wrote in his notes, \"These are the principles for the development of a complete mind: study the science of art, study the art of science. Realize that everything connects to everything else.\"</p><p>The intuitive understanding of a topic that these connections form in our minds is something Sal Khan praises throughout his book as well, specifically that it's given too less consideration when progressing students to more difficult levels of curriculum. Learning about a topic through the lenses of other subjects will help build this intuition.</p><p>There were probably a handful of moments I can recall in my school years when I was taught something with this level of intentionality and simplicity. At the same time, I remember the moments so well because they were not taught to me as the subjects they are but as practical applications. James Clear has a great line from the Mental Models article I mentioned at the start where he alludes to this:</p><p class=\"quote\">In school, we tend to separate knowledge into different silos—biology, economics, history, physics, philosophy. In the real world, information is rarely divided into neatly defined categories. In the words of Charlie Munger, \"All the wisdom of the world is not to be found in one little academic department.\"</p><p>As long as this unnatural separation of material persists in our schooling, it seems as though we must somehow come across the experience of liquid thinking ourselves. <a href=\"https://www.causal.app/\" class=\"link\">Causal</a>'s co-founder Taimur Abdaal has an excellent read discussing the moment he came across a similar learning process, in which he realized what it meant to <a href=\"https://taimur.me/posts/thinking-at-the-right-level-of-abstraction/\" class=\"link\">truly understand a concept intuitively</a>.</p><p>My thinking of 'knowledge as a network' continued when for the month of June (as part of my challenge to try a new habit each month) I thought to explore the countless paths my curiosity has led me down in the past and learn about one unfamiliar network a day. As time passed, I started noticing material I would learn in previous days began to correlate (and therefore help me learn about) topics in later days. By the first week, my brain started making high level connections between fields I had never previously considered. When I learned about the power grid and next day revisited some gaps I had on the protocols of packet routing in the internet, I was starting to see similarities between how resources can be managed and identities can be confirmed to provide an accurate power distribution or present the correct email. It was a bit spooky at first, to have a prior familiarity with a topic I thought was foreign.</p><p>I later came across the words for this marvel of a learning's byproducts producing an unexpected understanding in another realm, when I read Simon Sinek's encouragement of this phenomenon:</p><p class=\"quote\">You don't know what you don't know; never was there a truer sentence ever spoken. The question is, knowing we don't know everything, what's the best way to learn more? The answer is ironically obvious: look outside. I'm not talking about some existential vantage point, I mean literally, look outside. Step away from your desk and do something, see something, read something or listen to something that has nothing to do with your work. Do something that has nothing to do with what you know. To truly think differently, we need to look way outside our own industries. If we see and learn how others solve problems, we can adapt and apply the same lessons to our own work. Read about the Cuban missile crisis and we may learn how to get ourselves out of a sticky situation. Watch a documentary about origami and we may learn to see things a little differently. This is where innovation comes from. Innovation comes from solving ideas like no one else in our industry…but those ideas have to come from somewhere…somewhere outside.</p><p>Cherishing how little I know and using that humbling fact to fuel my curiosity in embracing new networks is what drives a good amount of my exploration. Recently that exploration has brought me into the world of tea cultivation and game theory - I'm excited to see where it takes me next. The goal here is to maintain a <a href=\"https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/how-to-read-lots-of-inputs-and-a-strong-filter/\" class=\"link\">high input strong filter</a>, where I'm overly open to learning about anything, but strict about what I choose to continue consuming and implement into my life.</p><p>Once adopting this 'networked' structure of thinking, a common fallacy I found myself falling less prey to is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/G_S_Bhogal/status/1225561133408493569?s=20\" class=\"link\">Causal Reductionism</a> or the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/G_S_Bhogal/status/1225561268175691779?s=20\" class=\"link\">Narrative Fallacy</a>. This is a concept I've been familiar with for some time, but it was formalized nicely on the Not Overthinking podcast episode titled <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/0GgDFF20jgJ3zadUXM3Lof?si=UUe53rfsRnGTw17rpzfOiA\" class=\"link\">40 Concepts for Understanding the World</a> The hosts read:</p><p class=\"quote\"> Things rarely happen for just one reason, usually outcomes result from many causes conspiring together but our minds cannot process such a complex arrangement so we tend to ascribe outcomes to single causes, reducing the web of causality to a mere thread.</p><p>The fallacy essentially exposes our default linear thinking trajectories (see <a href=\"https://fs.blog/2019/12/survivorship-bias/\" class=\"link\">Survivorship Bias</a> are unrepresentative of the actual insanely grand possibilities and causes that in fact had a play in anything happening in our lives. Information, as well as our lives, is a web of so much more than we can possibly fathom.</p><p>Sometimes recognizing this paralyzes me into being unsure of who I am and what I know, but most times it makes me fascinated to keep learning more, keep discovering what new paths the nodes of knowledge I currently hold have yet to take me down.</p>"

Samuel Ullman summarizes this metaphorical lens in his poem 'Youth':</p><p class=\"quote\">Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life. Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity of the appetite, for adventure over the love of ease. This often exists in a man of sixty more than a boy of twenty. Nobody grows old merely by a number of years. We grow old by deserting our ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirit back to dust. Whether sixty or sixteen, there is in every human being's heart the lure of wonder, the unfailing child-like appetite of what's next, and the joy of the game of living.</p><p>This 'unfailing, child-like appetite' and 'joy of the game of living' leads me to the next aspect of igniters that mesmerize me: their craft. Sometimes you may not be familiar with an igniter personally, but more so with the work they produce. If you think back to a time when you felt captured by a film or a performance, a similar vibrance of energy can arise. The last time this happened was when I attended a Bamboo Acrobatics show. There was so much about this performance that I could discuss, but in particular I was in awe at the beauty of a craft each acrobat had perfected through years of practice. It was how in tune they were to every minuscule body movement, the attention to detail when it came to the lighting complementing the music, and the effortlessly synced nature that seemed to emerge when it all coalesced.</p><p>Although this wasn't a conversation with an igniter, I left the auditorium amazed by the art this team has created together, an admiration that hung in my mind for the rest of the night. It was a reminder of how far the ability to create from our hands and mind can take us on our own, but even further when you venture down a creative journey as a team. It left me inspired to continue honing one of my long-lost hobbies in the arts, and get back in touch with dance.</p><p>Igniters may not be recognized as so by everyone. Someone I find to be an igniter could be a neutral acquaintance to another, with no desire to grow the relationship deeper. It could be someone you admire virtually, perhaps in your field. Even if the relationship doesn't exist in person, being exposed to their vulnerability, curiosity, or drive can jumpstart a path of growth in your life - be it for your career or any personal matters.</p><p>I'm beyond grateful for the igniters that have entered my life so far, and am always thrilled to discover more. They allow their light to shine, and in doing so ignite the light within others as well. They stand as a reminder of the immeasurable potential we all have to harness.</p>"

While the beauty in the sky unravelled during my ride home, I was captivated. For the rest of the trip, I observed the passing landscape through the car window, carrying a slight smile from gratitude bubbling up inside.</p><p>Back in the apartment, my mind hadn't quite left this moment from the car. Particularly, I was curious as to why this wonder of nature (that actually happens quite a bit in Austin) left me so entranced? I realized my thought pattern might have something to do with it. I wasn't just watching the sunset - I was noticing the gradients that arose in blurred pockets throughout the sky. Moments of observation like these often result in some form of gratitude, from which I concluded that sense of peace I was feeling must have been derived from. I felt grateful for my eyesight to be able to indulge in that stunning blend of colors.</p><p>This detailed perception is an arduous, unintuitive skill I've been slowing crafting for the past several years. An amalgamation of practices have contributed to its building - two big ones being mindfulness and intentionality with the content I consume. Borin Van Loon and Jane Hope come to a similar conclusion in <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00KFEJNY0/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_pP88FbVX4188E\" class=\"link\">Introducing Buddha</a>:</p><p class=\"quote\">We eat without tasting, we look without seeing and live without ever perceiving what is real. Every action, every thought or word is important and has consequences.</p><p>As someone who is intrigued by what builds an enriching life, a theme discussed consistently is gratitude. It seems to be at the epicenter of happiness, an unavoidable practice to achieving genuine satisfaction.</p><p>To express gratitude may require a polishing of the lens you normally view life with. It requires attention be paid to the minuscule activities you partake in or the events around you. When practiced repetitively, gratitude spreads a feeling of content unlike anything else can give. In an excellent discussion on The Ikonns podcast, Jim Kwick says: \"Life comes down to a series of decisions...Whether it is a virus or it is fear that spreads, so does kindness. So does wisdom. So does compassion. So does love.\"</p><p>A lot of what modern day life feeds our monkey brains only further inflames our deeply rooted instincts  of impatience, distraction, and hunger for connection. We must put in the effort to observe, to be mindful, and from there cultivating practices like gratitude and compassion feel natural. The famously quoted David Foster Wallace says:</p><p class=\"quote\">Learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think...It just depends what you want to consider. If you're automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won't consider possibilities that aren't annoying and miserable.</p><p>Is it fair to say those are our 'default' settings? Is it rather pessimistic to assume after all the thousands of years of human development that the qualities still driving so many of our decisions are rooted within the very values we shame ourselves in expressing? Situations can undeniably lead us to be fueled by values we aren't proud of, but I believe life feels a bit lighter when you recognize everyone is capable of fostering compassion so for now I'll continue with that narrative.</p><p>Saying 'I choose to be xyz person' or 'choose to feel said emotion' can be provocative, although I've seen comparable arguments for both sides. There are of course exceptions to any school of thought but for most cases in life I'd say actively choosing to be the kind of person you'd like to be, complete with the reactions you have and where or to whom you give your energy is an understated superpower. A counterargument that often comes up is that these ways of 'choosing yourself' can lead to inauthenticity or the pressure to be someone that doesn't feel like you since choosing implies 'pick anything you'd like.' Ali Abdaal gave a clever response to this in the Not Overthinking podcast episode 68 bits of Unsolicited Advice: Part 2:</p><p class=\"quote\">Being yourself is a complete myth. We are literally just a collection of accidents that happened in our upbringing, we did not choose the personalities that we ended up with for the most part, it's all just a result of accidents, so rather then just 'be yourself,' which is a load of BS, we should all be choosing ourselves to the extent that we want to. My default personality is fairly low energy, the person I am when I'm on camera and trying to actively be charismatic is very different to the person I'm at home and I'm just like a moody teenager. It would be utterly absurd for me to say \"I'm going to keep being myself even though being myself is the sort of guy that just wants to sit in front of a computer and play World of Warcraft all day.\" I don't think there is a thing as having a true personality.</p><p>Regardless of whether you agree with that bold last sentence, when you consider code switching or all of the times you've looked back and thought you've misacted in a situation that could have been better handled with some control, this quote rings true.</p><p>Just like any other practice, when done intentionally day after day, they can become habitual. Instinctive. This is what I'd like to happen with the way I observe the world, every little pattern and color and smile. When I'm in this state of mindfulness, gratitude comes naturally as I notice intricacies that can be marveled upon. <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0375504613/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_kQ88Fb28TCXTP\" class=\"link\">In A Short Guide to a Happy Life</a>, author Anna Quindlen shares an anecdote about a man she met at the beach who spoke of life with a charming sense of awe:</p><p class=\"quote\">He stared at the ocean and said, \"Look at the view, young lady. Look at the view.\" And every day, in some little way, I try to do what he said. I try to look at the view. That's all. Words of wisdom from a man with not a dime in his pocket, no place to go, nowhere to be. Look at the view. When I do what he said, I am never disappointed.</p><p>This entire post could be summarized into the words \"Look at the view.\" When chaotic situations with no rulebook leave you tunnel-visioned on all that's wrong with the world, remember to look at the view. It won't help you solve whatever life threw at you, but it will ensure you have the level-headed perspective as to not miss the low-hanging fruit of possible solutions.</p><p>The book is a short, wholesome collection of thoughts Anna has collected on living a fulfilled life. Before the book ends, she leaves the readers with her own parting wisdom on this topic:</p><p class=\"quote\">The best piece of advice I could give anyone is pretty simple: get a life. Get a life in which you notice the smell of the salt water pushing itself on a breeze over the dunes, a life in which you stop and watch how a red-tailed hawk circles over a pond and a stand of pines. Get a life in which you pay attention to the baby as she scowls with concentration when she tries to pick up a Cheerio with her thumb and first finger.</p><p>Thinking granular when practicing gratitude allows me to appreciate exactly how something came to be, along with the relationship I might have to it. It reminds me that everything is in fact a piece of a greater whole. It might even help to be a bit overdramatic with your observations initially, just to have fun with it, and gradually let it lead you where it will: When you view the seemingly little occurrences romantically, you unlock an experience to a world overflowing with gratitude. As Wallace reminds, us, the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over: 'This is water'.</p>"
