    content: 'We all tell ourselves stories everyday, about everyone and everything around us. These stories can be referred to as narratives. They are so embedded in the root of our ways, so subconscious, we often aren\'t even aware we function according to them. They are not necessarily mental models so much as they are the instinctive ways we explain the world and its happenings to our brains. Because they influence our instincts, they feed the everyday reactions we have and determine the vibrations we reverberate.',

    content: 'The beautifully monstrous world of the internet has enabled essentially every convenience we can think of today. Pondering of a world where it didn\'t exist would leave the incoming generation dumbfounded. We have adapted to it in remarkably irreversible ways, leaving us connected to a previously inconceivable degree. It\'s due to the internet\'s magnificence that we have the widespread capability to take our innovation as far as the reaches of our imagination.',

    content: 'Sometimes when faced with new advice, you may not yet be at a point in your life where that piece of information can resonate with you. This is the same reason why the timing of when you read a particular book can be imperative to your development, or why so many applications use algorithms in an attempt to tailor content to what they think you need most in that time. This is what happened when I came across a video titled The Toolbox Fallacy. I had heard of similar concepts in my early college years and saved it as a mental note to come back to later. I wasn\'t particularly infatuated with it then but I had a feeling the message being conveyed was something I may need to hear later in life.',

    content: 'By the end of my freshman year of college I had picked up a minor in Digital Arts. I wasn\'t quite sure where its relevance was to my Computer Science major but it peaked my curiosity and that was valuable enough. As I grew to enjoy the work Digital Arts classes required of me as much as (if not more) than what my Computer Science classes assigned, I was committed to figuring out a possible intersection between the two for my career. There is an evolving, exhilarating world that exists where design meets technology, and I was determined to be a part of it.',

    content: 'Towards the end of 2018, I was introduced to someone who I found to be captivating. It started off as a casual meetup over some food and ended up feeling like we were bothering the waiter for overstaying during rush hour. The conversations I had with this person lingered in my head for the next few days, but even more importantly the energy they imbued within me never quite left. I had an "I can" attitude towards everything afterwards and an extra bounce to my step.',

For the rest of the trip, I observed the passing landscape through the car window, carrying a slight smile from gratitude bubbling up inside.',
